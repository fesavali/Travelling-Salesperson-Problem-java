# Travelling-Salesperson-Problem-java
The traveling salesman problem is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization. 
This problem is to find the shortest path that a salesman should take to traverse through a list of cities and return to the origin city. 
The list of cities and the distance between each pair are provided.
TSP is useful in various applications in real life such as planning or logistics. 
For example, a concert tour manager who wants to schedule a series of performances for the band must determine the shortest path for 
the tour to ensure reducing traveling costs and not making the band unnecessarily exhausted.
This is an NP-hard problem. In simple words, it means you can not guarantee to find the shortest path w
ithin a reasonable time limit. This is not unique to TSP though. In real-world optimization problems, 
you frequently encounter problems for which you must find sub-optimal solutions instead of optimal ones.
